# Pepper Mod

A small Vintage Story code/content mod for perennial pepper plants.

## Status

Version 0.3.1 adds optional Biomes regional spawning support for jalapenos and habaneros.

Work in progress. Version 0.3.0 adds complete habanero plant and item models alongside the finished jalapenos. Both varieties have 11 plant states, picked fruit models, seeds, perennial growth, and spice effects. The new habanero artwork and gameplay integration have automated checks but still need a native in-game playtest. The other six varieties remain unfinished.

## Current Content

- Pepper plants with 8 initial growth stages, 2 mature regrowth stages, and 1 dormant winter stage
- Seeds for each pepper type
- Fresh vegetable items for each pepper type
- Scoville tooltips and two oven preparations: baked peppers, then long-lasting dried peppers
- Eight-pepper jalapeno and habanero bundles for baking 32 peppers in one full clay oven
- Ceiling-hung bundles that air-dry over seven in-game days
- Hold right-click for 1.5 seconds to harvest ripe plants without breaking them; peppers fall to the ground nearby
- Seasonal dormancy when temperatures are outside the growing range
- Rare wild jalapeno patches and rarer habanero patches in any biome with suitable soil
- Complete jalapeno and habanero growth, dormant, harvested, and regrowing models
- Matching 3D jalapeno and orange habanero fruit for inventory, held, and dropped items
- Habanero fruit progresses from green to orange on a broad, leafy bush
- Placeholder models for the six remaining pepper types

Current pepper types:

```

## Install For Testing

Only jalapenos and habaneros currently spawn wild, in any biome on suitable soil in newly generated terrain.
The remaining six varieties' wild spawning is disabled for now; their items and existing plants remain intact.
Existing terrain is not repopulated. Cold-weather dormancy and growing-season
temperature requirements still apply.

Build and install the compiled test package with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Build-PepperMod.ps1 -VintageStory "E:\Vintagestory" -Install
```

This is a code mod, so the release zip needs the compiled `peppermod.dll` at the root of the package. The build script creates `peppermod-0.3.1.zip` and copies it into your Vintage Story `Mods` folder when `-Install` is used. Keep only one version of Pepper Mod in that folder; move the old version outside it before testing this update.

## Biomes Compatibility

Optional support is included for [Biomes](https://mods.vintagestory.at/biomes),
tested against its 2.2.0 release on Vintage Story 1.22.3. No separate compatibility
download or required dependency is needed.

When Biomes is enabled, wild peppers follow its existing regional pepper rules:

- Jalapenos: Pacific Nearctic, Pacific Neotropic, and Atlantic Neotropic.
- Habaneros: Atlantic Neotropic.

Both can spawn near or away from rivers. Normal spawn rarity, suitable-soil checks,
and seasonal growing requirements are unchanged. Player-planted peppers are not
restricted by these world-generation rules. Without Biomes, wild peppers retain
their existing any-climate spawning rules.

In an existing Biomes world, explore newly generated terrain to find new patches;
existing terrain is not repopulated. When adding Biomes itself, follow its author's
recommendation to start a new world. This integration only adds our plant IDs to
Biomes' regional configuration; it does not alter terrain generation or other crops.

The optional asset is `assets/peppermod/config/biomes/blockconfig/peppermod.json`.
The released Biomes loader and plant filter are exercised in automated tests;
a combined in-game world-generation playtest is still recommended before release.

## Spice Effects

Raw jalapenos and habaneros provide 20 satiety instead of 80. Each completed bite adds spice:
banana pepper 10, poblano 15, jalapeno 25, serrano 40, cayenne 50, habanero 50,
and ghost pepper 100. Bell peppers add no spice. The remaining varieties retain 80 satiety.
Two habaneros eaten back-to-back fill the spice meter from empty.

Spice is capped at 100 and appears in a three-segment HUD near the lower-right:

- Mild: above 0 and below 34, with no gameplay effect.
- Hot: 34 to below 67, gently warming the player's body.
- Extreme: 67 to 100, retaining warmth, adding a slowly pulsing red edge tint,
  and draining 0.5 satiety per real-time second (1 point every 2 seconds).

The additional hunger drain stops below Extreme, does not change nutrition
levels, and does not apply in Creative or Spectator mode. Hunger cannot fall
below zero; ordinary starvation rules still apply when it is empty.

Spice never applies health damage directly or fires damage events. Warming adds up to 0.12
degrees per real-time second, capped at 2 degrees above normal body temperature.
It stops below Hot; ordinary temperature simulation then controls cooling.

After five seconds without another spicy bite, spice decays by one point per
real-time second. The HUD disappears at zero. Spice pauses while offline, is
saved with the player, and clears on death. Raw, baked, and dried whole peppers
apply spice; mixed cooked dishes do not yet inherit spice from their ingredients.

## Baking And Scoville Heat

Hover over a raw, baked, or dried pepper to see its Scoville heat units (SHU).
Each oven stage halves both SHU and the spice-meter dose. These fixed values
and cooking reductions are gameplay balance, not a simulation of real-world
capsaicin concentration or food preservation.

| Pepper | Raw SHU | Baked SHU | Dried SHU |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Jalapeno | 5,000 | 2,500 | 1,250 |
| Habanero | 250,000 | 125,000 | 62,500 |
| Serrano | 15,000 | 7,500 | 3,750 |
| Cayenne | 40,000 | 20,000 | 10,000 |
| Poblano | 1,500 | 750 | 375 |
| Bell pepper | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Banana pepper | 500 | 250 | 125 |
| Ghost pepper | 1,000,000 | 500,000 | 250,000 |

Use a heated clay oven, as for bread: raw pepper -> baked pepper -> dried pepper.
Remove peppers at the baked stage to keep them baked. Return them for a second
batch, or leave them in the oven longer, to dry them. Drying takes longer than
the first bake at the same temperature. Dried is the final stage; further baking
does not reduce heat again. There is no firepit or cooking-pot recipe.

Loose raw, baked, and dried peppers use dedicated oven transforms to lie flat and
centered in their slots. Inventory, held, and dropped-item transforms are unchanged.

Base freshness is 7 days for raw jalapenos and habaneros, 14 days (+/- 2) for other raw peppers,
7 days (+/- 1) for baked peppers, and 120 days for dried peppers, before temperature
and storage modifiers. After
freshness runs out, raw/baked peppers rot over 1 day and dried peppers over 7 days.
All three use normal food spoilage. The oven applies vanilla freshness carryover,
so an already-aged input does not produce a brand-new shelf-life timer.

Jalapeno spice doses are 25 / 12.5 / 6.25; habanero doses are 50 / 25 / 12.5.
Two raw habaneros still fill the meter from empty. Satiety is unchanged by baking.
Prepared forms also exist for the six unfinished varieties, without enabling
their wild spawning or replacing their placeholder geometry.

The implementation uses the game's [BakingProperties](https://apidocs.vintagestory.at/api/Vintagestory.API.Common.BakingProperties.html)
and the installed Vintage Story 1.22.3 oven behavior. See
`art/previews/prepared-peppers.html` for the raw/baked/dried item preview.

## Pepper Bundles

Tie eight matching jalapenos or habaneros with one **flax fiber** in the crafting grid:

```text
Pepper  Pepper  Pepper
Pepper  Fiber   Pepper
Pepper  Pepper  Pepper
```

All eight peppers must be the same variety and preparation: raw, baked, or dried.
One fiber is consumed per bundle. Bundles stack to eight and cannot be eaten directly.
Put one bundle anywhere in an otherwise empty crafting grid to unpack **eight peppers**
of that same variety and preparation. Unpacking does not return the fiber.

Each bundle takes one normal clay-oven slot, so four bundles process **32 peppers**.
The whole bundle progresses from raw to baked to dried at the existing baking times.
This does not change oven capacity or the behavior of other foods. The dried stage
is terminal, just like individual dried peppers.

Bundle tooltips show the pepper count and SHU **per pepper**, not eight times the SHU.
Shelf life matches the loose peppers. Tying uses the oldest ingredient's exact perish
timer; untying preserves it, preventing a freshness reset from repeated crafting.
Baking continues to use vanilla freshness carryover. A fully rotten bundle yields
two rot, equivalent to the normal rot ratio for eight peppers.

The six ristra-style item models have eight peppers arranged around a central cord
at varied heights and angles, with each stem directly touching the cord and no
outward string arms. They lie flat in the oven and when dropped. The models reference
the game's linen texture for their cord and reuse the existing pepper skins.
An interactive preview is available at `art/previews/pepper-bundles.html`.

Right-click the underside of a ceiling while holding a bundle to hang one from its
loop. A small iron hook appears between the ceiling and the string, with the loop
resting in its curved end. This is part of the placed model only, not an additional
crafting ingredient or item. No special ceiling material is required; the block must have a
supporting underside and an empty, dry space below it. Right-click a hung bundle
to take it down. If your inventory is full, it drops below the hanging point.
Removing its support or flooding its space also drops the bundle.

Raw and baked bundles air-dry directly into dried bundles after **168 in-game hours
(7 days)** hanging. The variety and eight-pepper count stay the same. Progress is
saved and catches up when a chunk reloads. Taking a bundle down pauses drying;
rehanging resumes its saved progress. Only elapsed game time counts, not time
while the world is stopped.

Raw and baked bundles spoil at half the normal rate while hanging, allowing fresh
bundles to finish drying. Carried bundles and hung dried bundles use normal rates.
Drying carries over freshness using the
game's food conversion rules, so it does not reset old food to brand-new condition.
A bundle that starts spoiling before drying finishes will not become dried food;
when fully spoiled it drops two rot. Dried bundles can stay hanging as decoration
but still have the long, finite dried-pepper shelf life.

## VSMC2 Workflow

Each plant is wired to load one shape per stage:

`assets/peppermod/shapes/block/plant/crop/{pepper}/stage{stage}.json`

Open the stage file you want in VSMC2, replace the placeholder geometry with your own model, and keep the texture keys named `stem`, `leaf`, `flower`, and `pepper` unless you also update the plant block JSON.

The active jalapeno and habanero files contain complete bush models. Habanero also
uses `peppergreen` for unripe fruit, mapped to the existing green pepper skin.
The separate
`jalapeno-candidate` folder and interactive previews are retained for reference
but excluded from the game package. Previous handmade stages are preserved in
the local, Git-ignored `backups` folder.

See `docs/pepper-vsmc2-guide.md` for the stage plan and file map.

## Regression Tests

The regression tests use the installed game's assemblies and assets and require no additional test packages:

```powershell
$env:VINTAGE_STORY = "E:\Vintagestory"
dotnet run --project .\tests\PepperMod.Tests\PepperMod.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

They cover hold timing, cancellation, changed targets, concurrent players, claims,
seasonal restrictions, harvest yield, downward-only item drops, both finished varieties' hand
placement, completed bites, spice tiers and cooldowns, body warming, no-damage
behavior, per-player state, habanero model/texture wiring, connected fruit and leaves,
mature canopy consistency, ripening colors, Scoville tooltips, reduced prepared-food spice,
vanilla oven conversions, terminal drying, freshness carryover, prepared model UVs,
bundle recipes and exact counts, inedible bundles, repeated tie/untie freshness,
32-pepper oven batches, cord attachments, and oven/ground model bounds. Hanging
tests cover placement, claims, inventory consumption, pickup, support loss,
flooding, air-drying, spoilage, save/reload, and large elapsed-time catch-up.
Native in-game testing is still needed for final
HUD appearance, animation, and interaction feel.

To additionally run the native Biomes compatibility test, set `BIOMES_TEST_ZIP`
to a locally downloaded `biomes_2.2.0.zip` before running the same test command.
This loads its configuration parser and plant filter without installing Biomes,
modifying a world, or adding its DLL to Pepper Mod's package. The test checks all
12 realms, both river states, asset loading order, and unchanged unrelated crops.
Without this variable, the ordinary tests still run and the native test is skipped.

## Roadmap

- Replace the remaining varieties' placeholder growth and dormant stage models
- Test planting, wild spawning, seasonal growth, right-click harvest, dormancy, and food item behavior in-game
- Add mixed-dish spice support and further spice recipes
